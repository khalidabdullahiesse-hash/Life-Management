Project Note

This project is a Habit Tracker Web App built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to help users track their daily habits and monitor their progress throughout the week in a simple and interactive way. It is designed for beginners as a practice project for web development, focusing on DOM manipulation, styling, and interactivity without using any frameworks.

Features and Functionality

Daily Habit Tracking: Users can mark their habits for each day by clicking on buttons, which toggle between active and inactive states.

Weekly Progress Visualization: The app automatically calculates the number of completed habits and displays the progress as a percentage bar.

Responsive Design: The layout is mobile-friendly and works well on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Simple User Interface: The interface is clean and minimal, ensuring that users can focus on their habits without distractions.

Interactive Elements: Buttons change visually when clicked, providing immediate feedback to the user.

How It Works

The main page lists all the habits the user wants to track.

Each habit has seven buttons representing days of the week.

When a user clicks a button, it toggles its state to “completed” or “not completed.”

The app calculates the total number of completed habits and updates the progress bar and percentage text automatically.

Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the page elements.

CSS3: For styling, layout, and responsive design.

JavaScript (Vanilla): For interactive functionality, event listeners, and progress calculation.

Learning Outcomes

Practiced DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

Learned how to dynamically update UI elements like progress bars.

Improved understanding of CSS styling, including flexbox, button states, and responsive design.

Gained experience organizing project files and writing clean, maintainable code.

Future Improvements

Adding local storage to save habits across sessions.

Allowing users to add or remove habits dynamically.

Enhancing progress visualization with charts or animations.

Adding notifications or reminders for uncompleted habits.

This project serves as a simple, yet functional example of how web technologies can be combined to create interactive tools that improve daily productivity and habit tracking. It is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn web development and build practical projects.
